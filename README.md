This small app allows to convert fiction book (fb2) files to epub format.
Convertation does not carried out by the app itself. Istead Fb2EpubClient sends fb2 files to the site http://fb2epub.com
and downloads converted file. Additionaly this app allows you to convert series of files and this is the main reason 
why it was created as the fb2epub.com does not provide such functionaliy. 

Fb2EpubClient is strongly tied to HTML forms of the site fb2epub.com, so possible changes to this site can stop the client
to work properly.

Why on earth you may need to convert fb2 books to epub? Fb2 format is widely spread in Russia and CIS countries and a lot 
of classic literature was scanned to fb2. However some applications such as iBook for iOS does not support fb2. Maybe 
there are also e-ink readers which doesn't support fb2 either.
